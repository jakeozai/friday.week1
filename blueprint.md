# Project Blueprint: Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A web application that generates 5 sets of 6 random lottery numbers. The design is inspired by the modern, minimalist, and bold aesthetic of the Gentle Monster brand, creating a unique and premium user experience.

## Design & Features

### V1 (Initial Implementation)

*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45 for each set.
    *   Generates 5 sets of numbers at a time.
    *   Displays the 5 sets of 6 numbers clearly to the user.
    *   A button allows the user to generate a new collection of sets at any time.

*   **Aesthetics (Gentle Monster Inspired):**
    *   **Layout:** A clean, centered, and spacious single-page layout that is fully responsive.
    *   **Color Palette:** A monochrome scheme using black, white, and shades of grey to create a sophisticated and high-contrast look.
    *   **Typography:** Utilizes the "Inter" Google Font for its clean and modern look. Large, bold font sizes for the numbers to make them the focal point.
    *   **UI Elements:**
        *   **Header:** A simple, elegant title for the application.
        *   **Number Display:** Generated numbers are displayed in distinct circular elements with a subtle shadow to create a "lifted" effect. Sets are displayed in rows.
        *   **Button:** A minimalist button with a clean hover effect to trigger number generation.
    *   **Background:** A subtle noise texture is applied to the background to give a premium, tactile feel.

## Current Plan

*   **Step 1:** Update the JavaScript logic to generate 5 sets of 6 unique random numbers.
*   **Step 2:** Modify the HTML and CSS to display the 5 sets in a clear, organized manner.
*   **Step 3:** Ensure the "Generate" button triggers the creation and display of the new sets.
